# GameOfLife


to run the game of life we have to run a server we specifically run live server from visual studio code

the languages used are HTML, CSS AND Javascript

the objectives for the first release are: the creation of the universe, the visualisation of the universe, the loading of preconfigured scenarios and the launching of the game.


we have been able to meet the objectives

the main difficulties within the code have been the photography and life counting functions.
